# paper-datatable

A [material design implementation of a data table](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/data-tables.html). Let's call this a pretty solid beta.

 - Documentation can be found [here](http://david-mulder.github.io/paper-datatable/components/paper-datatable/docs/docs.html?installation)
 - Demos can be found [here](http://david-mulder.github.io/paper-datatable/components/paper-datatable/demo/paper-datatable-card/full-implementation.html)

## Features

 - Custom `<template>`'ing of every cell.

		<paper-datatable-column header="Page" property="page">
			<template>
				<span>{{value}}</span>
			</template>
		</paper-datatable-column>

 - Two way binding directly into the `paper-datatable`

		<paper-datatable-column header="Page" property="page">
			<template>
				<paper-input value="{{value}}">
			</template>
		</paper-datatable-column>
 - Extremely simple to set up ([simple demo](http://david-mulder.github.io/paper-datatable/components/paper-datatable/demo/simple.html))
 - Pretty good styling support ([demo](http://david-mulder.github.io/paper-datatable/components/paper-datatable/demo/theming.html))
 - Pagination and external data sources ([demo](http://david-mulder.github.io/paper-datatable/components/paper-datatable/demo/users-card.html))
 - Supporting both inline editing and in Material Design dialogs.
 - ~~Add new items on the fly ([unpolished demo](http://david-mulder.github.io/paper-datatable/components/paper-datatable/demo/paper-datatable-card.html))~~
 - [Delightful details](https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/delightful-details.html) in sorting and partial selections. If you have ideas for more: let me know.
 - Usable on mobile. Only tested on Chrome for Android, and it's not great, but it doesn't overflow or overlap anything.

## Installation

The element can be installed using bower using

    bower install --save paper-datatable

**Important:** If you wish to use `<paper-datatable-card>` you need the paper elements listed in `devDependencies` as well. They are not listed as normal dependencies to prevent them from being pulled in on production if you do not need them.

## Usage

Check out the [getting started guide](http://david-mulder.github.io/paper-datatable/components/paper-datatable/docs/docs.html?getting-started).

## Run the demo

## Contributing

I absolutely HATE rejecting pull requests, so let me just outline some advice:

 1. If you are planning on doing anything except a quick fix, it's a wise idea to open an issue first with your plans. That
    way we can talk it through and check whether it might not already be easily possible and whether it fits with the
    spirit of the component (I try to keep everything pretty declarative, generic and Polymer-y).
 2. You absolutely *must* make every feature you work on at least a separate commit and ideally a separate pull request.
    This both makes it clearer to me what is what, makes it easier to pull only the relevant parts and prevents situations
    where I can't give credits to the good parts, because of the bad parts.
 3. You have to explicitly agree in your pull request to the terms described in the
    [fair share license construction](https://github.com/David-Mulder/fair-share-license/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
